## Raw Data

For each computational study presented in the paper, we downloaded or listed the drugs they found. Among the 276 unique ChEMBL IDs we found from studies, 169 had interaction data in DGIdb. 

### Liu 2016

Data was given as [supplementary](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12918-016-0362-4/MediaObjects/12918_2016_362_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx). In the article they report the drugs with an F score higher than 2. The dataset is downloaded as ./drugReview/data/raw/Liu2016/STable1.xlsx. We saved the first sheet, which is the one relevant to drugs as drugList.csv.

### Barardo 2017

The authors focus on the top 20 drugs in their ranked list of drugs. This list is given in the main text as a table. We copy the information. The data is saved as ./drugReview/data/raw/Barardo2017/drugList.csv.

### Yang 2018

The authors report the top 5 drugs in their ranked list of drugs (Table2). There are 2 that are repeated so there are just 3 unique drugs. The list is saved as ./drugReview/data/raw/Yang2018/drugList.csv

### Aliper2016

The authors focus on the top 10 drugs, which are listed in Table 1. The list is saved as ./drugReview/data/raw/Aliper2016/drugList.csv

### Calvert 2016

The authors report 11 significant drugs. This list is given in the main text as a table (Table1-2). We copy the information. The data is saved as ./drugReview/data/raw/Calvert2017/drugList.csv.

### Donertas 2018

The list of significant drugs is given as Table 1 in the main text of this article. We copy the information and save as ./drugReview/data/raw/Donertas2018/drugList.csv.

### Fernandes 2016

The list of significant drugs was reported in the supplementary material (Table S4). The list is saved as ./drugReview/data/raw/Fernandes2016/drugList.csv

### Snell 2016

The authors selected the top 10 drugs predicted to bind to each of 3 temperature sensing gene products (Table 2). From the 30 drugs, 27 are non-redundant. The data is saved as ./drugReview/data/raw/Snell2016/drugList.csv

### Snell 2018

The authors filtered 32 candidate drugs to be experimentally tested (Table 2). From the table or the paper we were not able to read 2 cases. The data is saved as ./drugReview/data/raw/Snell2018/drugList.csv

### Mofidifar 2018

The list of top compounds was reported in Table 1. The data is saved as ./drugReview/data/raw/Mofidifar2018/drugList.csv

### Zhiem 2017

The authors reported 15 compounds for two organisms. There are 24 non-redundant compounds in total. The data is saved as ./drugReview/data/raw/Ziehm2017/drugList.csv

### Fuentealba 2018

The list of significant drugs was reported in Table 2. The data is saved as ./drugReview/data/raw/Fuentealba2018/drugList.csv
