* Raw data compiled for each study: [README](data/raw/README.md)

* Description of the scripts: [README](scripts/README.md)

* A list of all studies, drugs, targeted genes, and their literature evidence: [link](data/processed/study_drug_gene_literature_masterList.tsv)

* A list of all studies and their pathway coverage, compared with the literature : [link](data/processed/study_pathway_literature_masterList.tsv)

* A summary figure for all studies, genes, drugs, and pathways: [Circular Heatmap](results/circularHeatmap.pdf)

* Drugs discovered by more than one study: [Study - Drug Network](results/st_drug_net.pdf)

* The distribution of genes by the number of studies: [Druggable Genome Distribution](results/druggableGenomeDist.pdf)

* Top 20 genes - targeted by the drugs discovered by the highest number of studes
